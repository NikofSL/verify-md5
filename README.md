# Explanation

The program calculates the MD5 hash of a specified file and compares it with an expected MD5 hash provided as an argument.
If the computed hash matches the expected hash, the verification is successful.
If they don't match, the program outputs the expected and computed hashes for comparison.
If there are issues opening or reading the file, the program outputs an appropriate error message.

# Compilation and Execution
Prerequisites: Ensure OpenSSL is installed on your system.
Compile the Program:
bash
Copy code
g++ -o verify_md5 verify_md5.cpp -lssl -lcrypto
This command compiles the program with OpenSSL libraries.
Run the Program:
bash
Copy code
./verify_md5 <file_name> <expected_md5_hash>
Replace <file_name> with the name of the file to verify and <expected_md5_hash> with the expected MD5 hash.

# Important Notes
MD5 Security: MD5 has known vulnerabilities and should not be used for cryptographic security. It is still useful for basic checksum purposes.
Error Handling: The program checks for invalid input, file-related errors, and other exceptions.
Flexibility: This example uses OpenSSL for MD5 calculation, which is widely supported on different platforms.
